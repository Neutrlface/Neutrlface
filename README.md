18 year old hs senior programming on and off since April 2023 

i work on random goofy projects for fun and/or my own convenience and wouldn't consider myself serious here, so download my garbage at your own discretion

my specs for those who care:
14700K (i know)
4070S (i know)
32 GB DDR5-5600 RAM
Windows 11 Professional 23H2 (please don't tell me to use linux)

i promise never to give intel nor nvidia my money ever again + withhold that i made a conscious choice on most of these things based on availability where i live
